Wealth Asset Management Database Documentation

Overview
The Wealth Asset Management database is designed to support a wealth management platform. It provides a structured and organized way to manage clients' portfolios, financial accounts, assets, transactions, and risk assessments. This database aims to help wealth managers oversee their clients' financial standings, evaluate risks, and generate insights and projections for future wealth growth.

The database comprises several tables, views, and stored procedures. It stores detailed information about clients, their portfolios, assets, accounts, and transaction histories. It also contains key metrics related to risk assessment and wealth projections. The views provide a summarized, digestible view of this data for wealth managers, while stored procedures perform complex operations such as risk assessment and portfolio analysis.

 Relationships and Integrity Constraints

- Foreign Keys: Enforce referential integrity between tables such as `ClientID` in `Portfolios` and `FinancialAccounts`, `PortfolioID` in `Assets` and `Transactions`, etc.
- Primary Keys: Uniquely identify each record in every table (e.g., `ClientID`, `PortfolioID`, `TransactionID`).
- Indexes: Optimize queries on common access patterns, particularly for foreign keys and portfolio summaries.

 Use Cases

1. Wealth Manager’s Dashboard
   - Uses views like `PortfolioAssetAllocation`, `ClientPortfolioValue`, and `OverallWealthSummary` to display an overview of a client’s wealth status and performance.

2. Client Portfolio Analysis
   - Wealth managers can execute stored procedures to perform deeper portfolio analysis, identify risks, and generate wealth projections for strategic planning.

3. Transaction Monitoring
